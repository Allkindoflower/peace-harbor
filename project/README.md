## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Allkindoflower/peace-harbor
   cd peace-harbor
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

The API will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

Interactive API documentation is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

## üìñ API Usage

### Wins Endpoints

**Create a new win:**
```http
POST /wins
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "win": "Successfully deployed my first FastAPI application"
}
```

**Retrieve all wins:**
```http
GET /wins
```

**Delete a specific win:**
```http
DELETE /wins/{win_id}
```

### Moods Endpoints

```http
POST /moods       # Create a mood entry
GET /moods        # Retrieve all mood entries
DELETE /moods/{id} # Delete a specific mood entry
```

### Thoughts Endpoints

```http
POST /thoughts       # Create a thought entry
GET /thoughts        # Retrieve all thought entries
DELETE /thoughts/{id} # Delete a specific thought entry
```

All endpoints follow the same CRUD pattern: `POST` to create, `GET` to fetch all, and `DELETE /{id}` to remove specific entries.

## üß™ Testing

Run the complete test suite:

```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is active
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=app

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_crud.py -v
```

Tests cover all CRUD operations and use isolated database sessions to prevent conflicts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Code Style

- Full type hints throughout the codebase
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Clean separation of concerns (routes, CRUD, models, schemas)
- SQLAlchemy ORM with proper type casting

### Database

The application uses SQLite (`stressed_out.db`) for development and testing.

> **Important**: The database file is intended for local development only. Do not commit production databases.

### Type Checking

SQLAlchemy ORM type hints can produce false positives with some static type checkers. Use `cast()` or `# type: ignore` where appropriate to satisfy type checkers without breaking runtime behavior.
